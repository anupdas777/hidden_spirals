### 1. Install the following MATLAB requirements and packages
- required MATLAB version: R2021B

### 2. Example
- Example code namely "main.m" is a MATLAB .m file that shows a demonstration of the frequency flattening method to reveal the hidden spirals. It takes a phase matrix as input and reveals the hidden spiral, if any, associated with it. Supporting functions Jacobian.m, minimize_eigenvalue.m, and sine_interpolation.m are also provided.
